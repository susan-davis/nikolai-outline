you here.  If not, then set fa.

Twenty years ago, you and your siblings attended the Imperial Academy 
Gymnasium.  Your best friend was Irina, and the two of you were close to 
the "ORG" trio of Oleg, Ruslan, and Gennady.  Your sister Millie had a 
crush on Gennady, who was attracted to Irina, and you and Irina both 
thought that Ruslan, the son of a knight, was utterly gorgeous.  Ruslan 
and Gennady both asked you to the dance.

You really want to go to the dance, and you've been looking forward to
it for some time.

Nikolai is furious.  Ruslan is the son of a knight, unsuitable for a
princess like you!  And how dare you defy him in such an important 
matter!  This touches on matters of interstellar relations, and could
affect the lives of billions.

Ruslan is disappointed.  He thought there was genuine attraction between

Gennady takes the news with just a bit too much equanimity.  He mentions
that he's heard good things about Huseyin, and is excited about meeting
him.  He also offhandedly inquires whether you know if Irina has a date
or not....

Your father is very upset.  Gennady is a promising young man from a
good family, but this touches on matters of interstellar relations, and 
could affect the lives of billions.  And how dare you defy your father!

Your father is very upset.  Oleg is a very suitable match, but as a

of billions.  And how dare you defy your father!

Oleg is crushed.  He knew you didn't mean it anyway, and what would

Irina is really touched to have such a good friend that you aren't willing
to let a boy come between the two of you (I+).  However, that evening, your
father asks you to go with Prince Huseyin of the DAI instead, for reasons
of state.

> GO WITH HUSEYIN
	goto -30-
> USE RUSLAN AS AN EXCUSE
	goto -39-

Irina is surprised.  She had always assumed that because your father was
behind the Empire's crusade to squash same-sex relationships, you were too.

	goto -26-

Your father rages at you some more, grounds you for a month (N-/-), and
forbids you to associate further with Ruslan.  He dragoons Millie into 
going with Huseyin instead, forcing her to break her date with Gennady.  
Perhaps one day she might possibly forgive you (L-).

"Sure, that would be great," he says.  The next day, you learn that he's
going to the dance with Irina.

R-, set da=H, ida=R, lda=G, ri=O, and goto -42-.

+----+

Ruslan and Irina make a handsome couple, and Irina is glad to have such
a good friend (I+).

Set da=H, ida=R, lda=G, ri=O, and goto -42-.

+----+
| 31 |

Irina had been hoping that Ruslan would ask her to the dance, but she 
hasn't heard anything.  She asks you for advice.

> SET HER UP WITH GENNADY
	goto -58-
> TELL HER TO WAIT FOR RUSLAN
	goto -59-

+----+
| 32 |

Gennady confides that he's thinking of asking Irina instead, but drops
the subject when you bring up the possibility of going with Ludmilla.
Millie is very excited, and glad to have such a thoughtful sister (M+).

Set da=H, ida=R, lda=G, ri=O, and goto -42-.

+----+
| 33 |
+----+

Gennady does a slow burn, then blows up and storms out in a fit (G-).  
The next day at school, he asks Irina to the dance, and blows up at her 
when she turns him down flat, having already accepted an invitation
from Ruslan.  The night before the dance, Millie excitedly tells you
that he's invited her.

Set da=H, ida=R, lda=G, ri=O, and goto -42-.

+----+
| 34 |
+----+

Gennady turns an interesting shade of pink, stammers, and hastily 
inquires about your sister, who just happens to be wandering past, and
joyfully accepts the not-actually-offered invitation.

Set da=H, ida=R, lda=G, ri=G, and goto -42-.

+----+
| 35 |
+----+

Your father is upset with you (N-/x), but since Ludmilla is free that
night, he sends her to the dance with Huseyin in your place, and the
storm blows over.

Set da=G, ida=R, lda=H, ri=O, and goto -42-.

+----+
| 36 |
+----+

Your father rages at you some more (N-/x), but because Oleg comes from such
a suitable family, he eventually gives in and dragoons Millie into going 
with Huseyin instead.  Perhaps one day she might possibly forgive you for 
having to break her date with Gennady.... (L-)

Set da=O, ida=R, lda=H, or, ri=G, and goto -42-.

+----+
| 37 |

Millie and Irina both already have dates, and by the time you talk to most 
of your other friends, they do too.

O-; set da=H, ida=R, lda=G, ri=O, and goto -42-.

+----+
| 38 |
+----+

Oleg's mood brightens considerably.  He understands all about noble family
obligations, and is glad to set a date for the following weekend instead.
He asks you to save him a dance.

Set da=H, ida=R, lda=G, ri=O, and goto -42-.

+----+
| 39 |

Nikolai is furious.  Ruslan is the son of a knight, unsuitable for a
princess like you!  And how dare you defy him in such an important 
matter!  This touches on matters of interstellar relations, and could
affect the lives of billions.

Irina leans into your kiss passionately (set ir).  She had had a huge crush 
on you a couple of years ago, but had let it develop into a friendship because
she thought she had no chance with you.  You spend some time making up 
for lost time.

That evening, your father asks you to go to the dance with Huseyin Ozturk,
son of the Khalifat of the DAI.

> TELL NIKOLAI ABOUT IRINA
	goto -41-
> AGREE TO GO WITH HUSEYIN
	goto -43-

+----+
| 41 |
+----+

You steel yourself to tell your father, finally work up the courage, and
he laughs at you.  "I know you're not enthusiastic about having your date
picked for you, but it's time that you faced up to your responsibilities
as a Princess of the Empire.  This is very important; would you do it for
me?"

> BACK DOWN
	goto -43-
> FETCH IRINA AND SNOG HER IN FRONT OF NIKOLAI
	goto -44-

The night of the dance finally arrives.  You and $da make a handsome 
couple.  You've just arrived.  Before you get to the dance floor, $ri
asks you for a dance.

Set dar=1, rir=0, daj=0, rij=1 (all -1 to 2).

> ACCEPT THE OFFER
	goto -46-
> DANCE WITH YOUR PARTNER INSTEAD
	goto -47-
> RESERVE HIM A LATER DANCE, THEN DANCE WITH YOUR PARTNER
	goto -48-

+----+
| 43 |

Dejectedly, you tell Irina that you're going to the dance with Huseyin,
at your father's orders.  She wants to know whether that means that the
two of you are off....

> ARRANGE TO GET TOGETHER AFTER THE DANCE
	goto -50-
> BE EVASIVE
	goto -49-
> TELL HER THAT YOU CAN'T HANDLE A RELATIONSHIP WITH ANOTHER GIRL
	goto -49-

+----+
| 44 |
+----+

When Nikolai finally wraps his head around the fact that you're really
serious about dating another girl, he promptly grounds you (N-/+) until
 after the dance.  He banishes Irina from the castle, and orders you not 
to see her again.

> SNEAK OUT OF THE CASTLE
	set da=I and goto -52-
> MOPE
	goto -51-

+----+
| 45 |

You explain to Ruslan that your father is forcing you to *go* with Huseyin,
but that doesn't mean that you have to *leave* with him, or even spend most
of the night dancing with him.

Set da=H, ida=x, lda=G, ri=R, and goto -42-.

Irina is disapponted.  She believes in the two of you, and wishes that
you would, too.  The two of you have a huge fight, and don't speak for
a couple of days.  Eventually, the night of the dance arrives....

I-, set ir, da=H, ida=R, lda=G, oda=x, ri=I

+----+
| 50 |
+----+

You kiss again to seal the pact, and spend an inordinate amount of time
"studying together" over the intervening week.

Set ir, da=H, ida=A, lda=G, oda=x, ri=I

+----+
| 51 |

While you're stuck at home, Oleg drops by to try to cheer you up.  It
becomes obvious during your conversation that he's carrying a torch for
you.

In the real game, there'll be a minigame for trying to sneak out.  In the
paper prototype, flip a coin and try to call it successfully in the air.

If you succeeded, you snuck out of the palace to meet $da.  Goto -53-.

If you failed, you were caught in the attempt.  Goto -54-.

If you'd rather not risk being caught, goto -51-.

You spend a wild night of passion together, and pledge your undying love.

Set Spo=da, sp=1.

The flashback ends; go back to the number that you saved.

| 54 |

Nikolai won't even speak to you after you are caught.  Instead, he has $da
dismissed from the Gymnasium and sent away from court.  He also has your
communications monitored.  You eventually learn which university your 
paramour intends to attend, but don't see them again until after graduation.

Goto -57-.

+----+
| 55 |

You quickly become a fast couple, and missing the dance doesn't seem so
bad.  When it becomes apparent that you two are an item, Nikolai approves,
as Oleg's father is an old war buddy of his.

Set Spo=O, sp=1.

The flashback ends; go back to the number that you saved.

Oleg is a good friend, but you don't think of him That Way.  You remain
good friends, however.

Goto -57-.

For reasons of state, your father arranges an engagement between you and
Huseyin.  You are to be given until both of you graduate from university
to get to know each other, at which time a Royal Wedding will be scheduled.

TODO:
  - At least one designated rival will try to get together with Anya.
  - If Gennady and Irina aren't at the dance together, he hits on her.
  - If Irina and Ruslan aren't at the dance together, she asks him to dance.
  - If Anya isn't at the dance with Oleg, he asks her to dance at least once.
  - Both Anya's date and the rival will try to get Anya alone to make out.

  - Each primary character triggers a different flashback with Anya.
  - There's more than one Anya-and-Nikolai flashback, too.
  - There are also mandatory flashbacks to pick a major/university,
    to deal with a complication in Anya's marriage, and at a turning
    point in Anya's career.
  - Does Anya get pregnant?  Does she have children?
